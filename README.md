# First_Timer
## Description
Not every study goal should be 'todo list', it could be total study hours in a day. Most of timers are just functioning as a timer and users are using them just for time management. It is better to use timer with tracking total study hours for today. Set a goal such as "TODAY'S STUDY GOAL IS 10 HOURS". Use timer as regular timer app. Have a short break time or keep continue to study. Whenever the study is finished, just click 'save' button. It will automatically save the total study hour for today.
